Hi there! I've put together this little app to practice both GUI creation using Tkinter and webscraping via Beautiful Soup. 
It's still very much a work in progress and I'm currently working on the following issues:
Link button: function is supposed to output all links contained in the supplied URL, but as of now the only output displayed is the very last URL
Picture button: looking into possibly adding an additional function that will scrape jpegs.
