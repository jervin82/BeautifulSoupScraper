Hi there! I've put together this little app to practice both GUI creation using Tkinter and webscraping via Beautiful Soup. 
It's still very much a work in progress and I'm currently working on the following issues:

Come up with a way to clean the output of usesless characters and markup.
Come up with a "process complete" notification.
App window appears to open beind already open windows.
